If you win your risk-free bet (you can choose which game to put it on), nothing happens, because you won the bet and get your winnings. If you lose, you’ll be credited money back in a separate part of your account.</span></p>\n<p><span>Those $500 in free bets are effectively in a different portion of your account from your $500 cash because you can’t withdraw them right away. But once you put the free bets into play once, any winnings from those wagers will go into the cash portion of your account, which you can withdraw at any time.</span></p>\n<p><span>Note that the $500 risk-free bet is a one-time thing, so if your first bet after signing up for an account is just $20, that will be your risk-free bet. Make sure to optimize that first wager to get the biggest bang for your buck.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many sportsbooks require large rollovers to access bonus funds — i.e. you deposit $500 and get a $500 match, but have to bet 10 times the deposit amount ($5,000 in this case) before ever being eligible to withdraw the bonus money.</span></p>\n<p><span>So having just a 1x rollover is a great perk.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3>How fast can I withdraw money from my FanDuel account?</h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Among the biggest benefits to betting at a</span> <a href=\"https://www.actionnetwork.com/online-sports-betting\" target=\"_blank\"><span>legal online sportsbook</span></a> <span>like FanDuel is that money will be in your bank account just a few days after requesting a payout.</span></p>\n<p><span>You can hook up your bank account to direct deposit both ways — putting money onto FanDuel and taking it out.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3>Is FanDuel Sportsbook safe?</h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Yes, FanDuel is safe. When talking about sports betting, there are probably two boxes to check…</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3>Is my money safe on FanDuel?</h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Yes.

If you feel like you’re gambling irresponsibly, you can put a temporary ban on your own account — anywhere from three days to 12 months — or permanently close your account.</span></p>\n<p><span>You can also set deposit limits, spending limits and time limits on your account.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>What are the minimum and maximum amounts I can deposit?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><br><span>The minimum deposit amount on FanDuel is $10 and the maximum deposit is $10,000.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>Does FanDuel charge fees?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>FanDuel will not charge you fees for depositing or withdrawing. But all sportsbooks charge “juice” or “vig” on each bet — meaning you need to risk more than you’ll win.</span></p>\n<p><span>Juice differs by sportsbook, but on a standard NFL point spread bet, you’re paying 10% to the book to take your action.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>Do I have to be a resident of New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, West Virginia or Indiana to bet on FanDuel?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Nope. You just need to be inside the state border, at least 21 years old and a United States citizen.</span></p>\n<p><span>FanDuel will automatically verify your location through your phone or computer GPS. As long as you’re in the state, you can bet.

It also takes credit cards, bank account direct deposits, wire transfers and more.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>Does FanDuel have an app?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>FanDuel has one of the better mobile apps among legal U.S. sportsbooks. You’re not required to bet on the app, though, and can instead use the website on desktop or mobile.</span></p>\n<p><span>You can</span> <a href=\"https://www.fanduel.com/apps-53-hidden\" target=\"_blank\"><span>download the app here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3>Why does FanDuel need my social security number and other personal information?</h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>FanDuel uses your social security number to verify your age and identity, above all. Operators are required to keep your information safe and secure.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>Are FanDuel winnings taxed?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>FanDuel itself is paying the actual taxes to the states it’s operating in. Those will be effectively invisible to the consumer.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, your sports betting winnings at any book, including FanDuel, are taxable.</span></p>\n<p><span>The operator will send you a W-2G form if you win more than $600 net with that sportsbook.</span></p>\n<p><span>Gambling losses can be written off as a tax deduction, but only if you also report any money won as taxable income. You do need to itemize your deductions; you can’t claim any gambling losses with a standard deduction.</span></p>\n<p><span>The amount of gambling losses you can deduct can’t exceed the winnings you report as income. With $1,000 in winnings but $2,000 in losses, your deduction is limited to $1,000. You can’t write off the other $1,000 you lost.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3>How is FanDuel different from Bovada?</h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Bovada and FanDuel have one major difference that will go a long way in keeping you protected: Bovada is an illegal, offshore sportsbook that’s not regulated by any governing body.</span></p>\n<p><span>For that reason, your funds are never truly safe with an offshore company. You have no recourse if they defraud you.</span></p>\n<p><span>FanDuel, on the other hand, has to pass rigorous measures set by state gaming departments, and all money is insured since legal operators must have separate accounts with backup funds for players in case they go out of business.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other huge benefits to using FanDuel as opposed to illegal sportsbooks:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>1.</strong></span> <span>You can deposit and withdraw money using your bank account or credit card and don’t need to rely on cryptocurrencies or shady MoneyGrams.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>2.</strong></span> <span>Your bonuses are not subject to massive rollover requirements, so you’ll actually see the bonus money in a timely fashion.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>3.</strong></span> <span>You’ll get money nearly instantly when withdrawing.

Basically, you can’t just deposit $100 to your DFS account then transfer it or access it through your sportsbook account without first using it to play in DFS contests.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>Why can’t I bet in a state that allows DFS?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>You may not be able to bet on sports in a state that allows DFS because the legislation is not the same — the legalization of DFS does not mean the legalization of sports betting.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>How do I make a deposit at DraftKings Sportsbook?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>You can make a deposit at DraftKings Sportsbook with various payment methods, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Debit cards</span></li>\n<li><span>Credit cards</span></li>\n<li><span>Wire transfer</span></li>\n<li><span>Paypal</span></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>How do I withdraw DraftKings Sportsbook payouts?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>You can withdraw DraftKings Sportsbook payouts via the following options:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>ACH</span></li>\n<li><span>Check</span></li>\n<li><span>Paypal</span></li>\n<li><span>Casino cage</span></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>Is DraftKings Sportsbook legit?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Yes, DraftKings Sportsbook is legit.

If every bet in a parlay wins, then you earn a higher payout than if you would have placed them as single bets.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here’s a quick example: If you bet $75 on a three-team parlay featuring the Lakers +100, Bucks +200 and Raptors +250 — and all three teams win — you would net $1,500 rather than the $137.5 you would have netted if you had made $25 single bets on all three teams.</span></p>\n<p><span>You can calculate potential parlay payouts using our</span> <a href=\"https://www.actionnetwork.com/betting-calculators/parlay-calculator\" target=\"_blank\"><span>calculator</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span>How do you bet a teaser on DraftKings Sportsbook?</span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>You bet a teaser on DraftKings Sportsbook by parlaying multiple point spreads or totals in which the lines are each teased down in exchange for a lower payout.

However, like all sportsbooks, PointsBet does charge a tax — also called the “vig” or “juice” — which is the price of making the bet. For most bets, the vig is 10%, which means you’d have to bet $110 to win $100. PointsBet does often offer lower juice, though. For instance, for NFL and NBA spreads, they charge just a 5% fee, which means you’d have to bet $105 to win $100. That is the lowest vig you’ll find at any sportsbook in the world.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>What devices can I use to bet on at PointsBet?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>PointsBet has free iPhone and Android applications that bettors in New Jersey and Indiana can use to bet. Of course, bettors can also make bets online on a desktop or mobile browser.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>What is BetSync?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>BetSync is a proprietary technology created by The Action Network that works with sportsbook platforms.

Your money and personal information are completely secured. PointsBet operates like any U.S. business, which means they have to report earnings and pay taxes.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Is PointsBet legit?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Yes, PointsBet is definitely legit.

Those $250 in free bets are effectively in a different portion of your account from your $250 cash, but once you put the free bets into play once, any winnings from those wagers will go into the cash portion of your account, which you can withdraw at any time.</span></p>\n<p><span>Plenty of sportsbooks require bettors to roll over their bonuses several times before allowing you to withdraw the funds, but that’s not the case at BetRivers. Another benefit: You’re not forced to use your free bets on a single wager. Using the example before, you could spread that $250 in free bets out into 10 different $25 bets if you wanted; you could also plop all $250 down on one wager. The choice is yours, which is all you can ask for as a bettor.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Can I use my bonus bets on any type of wager at BetRivers?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>There are very few restrictions for how you can use the bonus funds you get from taking advantage of BetRivers’ deposit match offer. The one exception: You cannot use your free bets on any wager that has greater than -200 odds. In other words, a -205 bet would be ineligible, but a -195 would be eligible. This isn’t the worst news, though, as it’s often most profitable over the long term to use bonus bets on wagers that are plus-money and you’re getting a decent edge over the market.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>How do I get free bets at BetRivers?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>The easiest way to get free bets at BetRivers is to sign up for a new account through one of these links —</span> <a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=250&context=book-review-page\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Colorado</span></a> <span>|</span> <a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=122&context=book-review-page\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Pennsylvania</span></a> <span>|</span> <a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=121&context=book-review-page\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Indiana</span></a><span>. Be sure to include promo code</span> <span><strong>250MATCH</strong></span> <span>when you’re going through the registration flow as well.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once you’ve registered, the next step to getting your free bets is to fund your account via one of the many methods BetRivers provides: online banking, PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover. (Important note: Some credit and debit cards will not allow you to deposit money into a sportsbook account, so your best bet is often online banking or PayPal.)</span></p>\n<p><span>When choosing the amount to deposit into your BetRivers account, remember that your free bets are directly tied to your deposit amount. If you deposit $100, you’ll receive $100 in free bets. If you deposit $175, you’ll receive $175 in free bets. You get the picture. The important thing to be aware of is that BetRivers caps its deposit match at $250, so if you put $1,000 into your account, you’ll get $250 in free bets — the same amount you’d get if you opted to deposit $250.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once you make your first deposit, you don’t get a second chance to claim that deposit match, so make sure you do it when you’re able to maximize your free bets.

You only have to be 21 years of age, a U.S. citizen and inside the state’s borders to place a bet on BetRivers’ platform.

Indiana, for example, borders</span> <a href=\"https://www.actionnetwork.com/online-sports-betting/kentucky\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Kentucky</span></a><span>,</span> <a href=\"https://www.actionnetwork.com/online-sports-betting/ohio\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Ohio</span></a><span>,</span> <a href=\"https://www.actionnetwork.com/online-sports-betting/michigan\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Michigan</span></a> <span>and Illinois, and plenty of bettors from those states have crossed into Hoosier land for the sole purpose of placing a bet before turning around and heading back home. Because it’s such an easy process to sign up for an account with the promo code, claim your bonus and bet, you can make a quick trip out of it, no problem.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you open a BetRivers account in one state and travel to another one where it has an online sportsbook, you can use your same login credentials to bet, though the BetRivers sportsbooks in each state have their own distinct homepages.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Can I withdraw from my BetRivers account if I’m not in Colorado, Pennsylvania or Indiana?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>You can actually withdraw funds from your BetRivers account when you’re not in Colorado, Pennsylvania or Indiana. The same goes for registering and making a deposit. The only thing you can’t do is place bets, as BetRivers is required to follow strict regulations to not allow mobile betting outside of regions where it’s legally allowed.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>What type of devices can I create a BetRivers account and bet on while in Colorado, Pennsylvania or Indiana?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>You can register for your BetRivers account on either your phone (iOS or Android) or your computer (Mac and PC). The same goes for depositing.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Can I deposit into my BetRivers account via PayPal?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>Yes, you can deposit into your BetRivers account via PayPal. In fact, PayPal is often one of the quickest ways to fund and withdraw from sportsbook accounts, so we recommend using it.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Does BetRivers have an app?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>BetRivers has an Android app, which you can download after signing up for your account. You’re not required to bet through the app, though. You can simply place your wagers on BetRivers’ mobile or desktop website. As of April 2020, BetRivers did not have an iPhone app.</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Why does BetRivers need my social security number and other personal information?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>As part of being a regulated sportsbook in Colorado, Pennsylvania and Indiana, BetRivers is required to verify your identity and ensure that you’re of legal betting age (21) before allowing you to create an account. BetRivers is also required to keep your information safe and says it ensures “our data privacy procedures and processes exceed the industry standards.”</span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>How is BetRivers different from Bovada?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>There are many, many important differences between BetRivers and Bovada. For one, Bovada is an illegal sportsbook in the United States. It is based outside the U.S., and perhaps most importantly, it is not regulated by the federal government or any specific state. This means that, as a bettor, you have very little protection or recourse against Bovada should it attempt to defraud you.</span></p>\n<p><span>In contrast, BetRivers has to go through a rigorous regulatory process to become a legal online sportsbook in the states of Colorado, Pennsylvania and Indiana. It has to follow the rules set forth by those states. It’s required to report its betting handle to the state and to pay taxes like any other business.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other huge benefits to using BetRivers as opposed to illegal sportsbooks:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>You can deposit and bet with ease (within seconds of making your deposit).</span></li>\n<li><span>The bonus you receive is not subject to arduous rollover requirements; you only have to roll over your free bets once before being able to withdraw the money from your account.</span></li>\n<li><span>It won’t take you weeks and weeks to receive your money when you request a withdrawal. Instead, you’ll get the money in your account in just a few days max, and as soon as 24 hours if you use PayPal or have it transferred to your bank account.</span></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Is BetRivers legit?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>BetRivers is definitely legit. We’ll detail some other great benefits of betting through BetRivers in a bit, but its deposit match offer alone makes it a worthwhile sportsbook to have in your portfolio. Not many sportsbooks will offer to hand you up to $250 in free bets after depositing, but BetRivers does. And even better: You’re subject to only a 1x rollover, meaning you withdraw whatever you turn your free bets into. That’s one of the best rollover policies we’ve seen from any sportsbook.</span></p>\n<p><span><em>[Get a $250 deposit match when you</em></span> <a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=250&context=web-book-review-page\" target=\"_self\"><span><em>sign up here for BetRivers</em></span></a><span><em>]</em></span></p>\n"},{"question":"<h3><span><strong>Who owns BetRivers?</strong></span></h3>\n","answer":"<p><span>BetRivers is owned by a company called Rush Street Gaming, which is based in Chicago and owns sportsbooks and casinos all over the country.
